# Ragpi Discord integration

Ragpi's Discord integration allows you to easily connect your technical documentation and knowledge base with your Discord community. By deploying a Discord bot powered by Ragpi, users can ask questions and receive AI-assisted answers directly within Discord channels.

Check out the [Ragpi Discord integration documentation](https://docs.ragpi.io/integrations/discord) to learn more about how to set up and use the integration.

You can also visit the [Core Ragpi Repo](https://github.com/ragpi/ragpi) to learn more about project.
